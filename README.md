# Course Information
In this course, students will learn the basic concepts of numerical analysis. 
In the first part of the course, students will learn the way that computers represent numbers and how to use them in calculations. 
In the second part, we will focus on the numerical methods for solving linear equations. 
In the following sections, we will learn about the numerical derivatives and integrals. 
In the end, we will use these skills to solve some nonlinear equations. 
In all applications, we will use Python to solve the problems. 
You can find some supplementary videos for this course on my YouTube channel.

# Wiki
Some concepts are emphasized in Wiki pages, you can find them in the following link.

[Wiki Pages](https://github.com/canbula/NumericalAnalysis/wiki)

# Weekly Content
You can find the codes that written in the laboratory in the folder WeekXX.

# Lecture Notes and Problem Sets
In the root folder there is a LectureNotes.pdf file, which is updated weekly after every lecture. 
At the end of the every chapter, you will also find a Problem Set.

# Homeworks
Students are requested to submit their homeworks to folders WeekXX, as defined in the LectureNotes.pdf. 
The codes will be subject to certain GitHub action workflows to be tested automatically.
